## Introduction

In this document, we will analyze the Olympic `medal` dataset, focusing on gold medals and using `GDP` and `population` data as predictors.

## Part a: Selection of Variables

-   In this analysis, we are going to include GDP(`gdp`) and population(`pop`) as predictor variables, and `gold medals` as the responses variable. Gold metals tend to represent the highest achievements at the Olympics. GDP can significantly impact the training and development of athletes, infrastructure, and support systems for sports. Population size reflects the potential talent pool from which a country can draw athletes. As a result, GDP and populations have been widely used in sports research as a predictor of international success, as they are closely related to the resources available to support Olympic athletes.

### Load and Clean the Data

```{r}
# Load the Olympic dataset
mydat <- read.csv(url("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bbolker/stats720/main/data/olymp1.csv"))

# Filter for gold medals
newdata <- mydat |> filter(medal == "Gold")

# Clean the data by dropping rows with missing values for GDP and population
newdata_clean <- newdata |> drop_na(gdp, pop)
```

### Log-Transforming the Variables

-   Log-transforming predictors like GDP and population can make the relationships between variables more linear and easier to model. By log-transforming, you're modeling the proportional changes in the predictors (GDP and population) rather than absolute changes.
-   If the distribution of the number of gold medals is highly skewed (with many zeros and a few large values), log-transforming the response variable `n` can help to stabilize variance and make the data more suitable for linear modeling.

```{r}
newdata_clean <- newdata_clean |> 
  mutate(log_gdp = log(gdp + 1), 
         log_pop = log(pop + 1),
         log_n = log(n + 1))
```

### Splines for Non-Linear Relationships

-   If the relationships between GDP, population, and gold medals are non-linear, using natural splines allows you to model these relationships in a flexible way without overfitting.

```{r}
# Natural spline with 5 degrees of freedom for GDP and Population
model <- lm(n ~ ns(gdp, df=5) + ns(pop, df=5), data = newdata_clean)
model_log <- lm(log_n ~ ns(log_gdp, df = 5) + ns(log_pop, df = 5), data = newdata_clean)
summary(model)
summary(model_log)
```

-   The **original model** had a higher R-squared (**0.7486**), explaining 74.86% of the variability in gold medals, but with a relatively high residual standard error (RSE) of **8.293**, indicating issues with extreme values. In contrast, the **log-transformed model** had a lower R-squared (**0.506**), explaining 50.6% of the variability, but a much lower RSE (**0.859**), suggesting a more stable fit when modeling proportional changes. Significant coefficients for the log-transformed GDP splines (e.g., **6.00314** for `ns(log_gdp, df = 5)5`) highlight a strong non-linear relationship between GDP and gold medals.

-   The **log-transformed model** better captures proportional changes, making it the preferred choice for predicting gold medals based on GDP and population.

### Interaction

-   The interaction between **GDP** and **population** might influence the number of gold medals (i.e., countries with large populations and high GDPs perform better).

```{r}
# Include interaction between log_gdp and log_pop
model_interaction <- lm(log_n ~ ns(log_gdp, df = 5) * ns(log_pop, df = 5), data = newdata_clean)
summary(model_interaction)
```

### Choice of Model

-   The interaction model improves on the log-transformed model, with a higher R-squared (**0.5926** vs **0.506**) and a lower residual standard error (**0.7991** vs **0.859**). This suggests that the interaction model explains more variability and provides a better fit. The significant interaction terms (p \< 0.001) indicate non-linear interactions between GDP and population in predicting Olympic success.

-   Given its better fit and ability to capture the complexity of the relationships between GDP, population, and gold medal counts, the **interaction model** is preferred for understanding how these factors jointly influence Olympic outcomes.

## Part b: Units and Thresholds

### Response Variable: Log of Gold Medals (`log_n`)

-   **Unit**: The log of the number of gold medals (log-transformed count of medals).
-   **Reasonable Threshold for Small Change**: A 10% proportional change, corresponding to 0.1 units in the log scale.

### Predictor 1: Log of GDP (`log_gdp`)

-   **Unit**: The log of GDP, where GDP is measured in billions of US dollars.
-   **Reasonable Threshold for Small Change**: A 10% proportional change, corresponding to 0.1 units in the log scale.

### Predictor 2: Log of Population (`log_pop`)

-   **Unit**: The log of population, where population is measured in millions of people.
-   **Reasonable Threshold for Small Change**: A 10% proportional change, corresponding to 0.1 units in the log scale.

## Part c: Model Fitting

```{r}
# Fit the interaction model with log-transformed variables and splines
model_interaction <- lm(log_n ~ ns(log_gdp, df = 5) * ns(log_pop, df = 5), data = newdata_clean)
summary(model_interaction)
```

-   **R-squared**: 0.5926, meaning that the model explains 59.26% of the variability in the log-transformed number of gold medals.

-   **Residual Standard Error (RSE)**: 0.7991, indicating a reasonably good fit, with relatively small deviations from the observed values.

-   **Significant Interaction Terms**: Several interaction terms between log_gdp and log_pop are statistically significant (p \< 0.001), highlighting important non-linear relationships between GDP and population in predicting Olympic success.

## Part d: Model Diagnostics

```{r}
# Base R diagnostic plots
par(mar = c(5, 4, 4, 2) + 0.1)
plot(model_interaction)
```

-   **Linearity**: The **Residuals vs Fitted plot** shows a slight curvature, suggesting that the model might not fully capture the non-linear relationship between the predictors and the response. This non-linearity indicates that some interactions or non-linear terms might still be missing from the model, despite using splines.

-   **Normality of Residuals**: The **Q-Q plot** suggests that the residuals are roughly normally distributed. However, the deviations at both the lower and upper tails indicate that there are some extreme values, which may not be well-captured by the model, potentially outliers.

-   **Homoscedasticity**: The **Scale-Location plot** shows some evidence of heteroscedasticity. The spread of the residuals appears to increase with the fitted values, which suggests that the variance of the residuals is not constant across all levels of the predicted values. This indicates that the assumption of homoscedasticity might be violated.

-   **Outliers/Influential Points**: The **Residuals vs Leverage plot** highlights a few points with high leverage, particularly observations 81, 100, and 233. These points might be exerting a significant influence on the model, and it may be worthwhile to investigate them further. Additionally, these points do not seem to fall under the Cookâ€™s distance threshold, meaning that although they have leverage, they may not have an outsized effect on the model's overall fit.

## Part e: Model Adjustments

### Robust Standard Errors:

-   Since the **Scale-Location plot** suggest **heteroscedasticity**, one option is to use **robust standard errors** to adjust for non-constant variance in the residuals. This can provide more reliable inference even if the residuals do not have constant variance.

```{r}
# Fit the interaction model
model_interaction <- lm(log_n ~ ns(log_gdp, df = 5) * ns(log_pop, df = 5), data = newdata_clean)

# Use coeftest() with vcovHC for robust standard errors
robust_se_model <- coeftest(model_interaction, vcov = vcovHC(model_interaction, type = "HC3"))

# Display the results with robust standard errors
print(robust_se_model)
```

-   **Robust standard errors** adjust the estimates to account for any unevenness in the residuals (heteroscedasticity). This makes the results more reliable, especially in models with potential data issues like this one. Some previously marginally significant interactions (e.g., the combined effects of GDP and population) are now more robustly significant, confirming that these interactions are key in predicting gold medals.

### Generalized Linear Models

-   Given that the response variable is the **number of gold medals** (a count variable), the **Poisson regression** or **Negative Binomial regression** might be appropriate.

#### Poisson regression

-   In Poisson regression, the log of the expected number of events is modeled as a linear combination of the predictor variables.

-   The canonical link function for Poisson regression is the **log link**.

```{r}
# Fit a Poisson GLM
model_glm_poisson <- glm(n ~ log_gdp + log_pop, family = poisson(link = "log"), data = newdata_clean)

# Summary of the model
summary(model_glm_poisson)
```

-   **Intercept**: The estimated intercept of $-2.78$ means that when GDP and population are at their log-transformed value of zero (which theoretically would be when GDP and population are both 1), the expected number of gold medals is quite low.

-   **log_gdp**: A 1-unit increase in log-transformed GDP is associated with an 81% increase in the expected number of gold medals ($e^{0.81007} \approx 2.25$, or a multiplicative effect of 2.25).

-   **log_pop**: A 1-unit increase in log-transformed population is associated with a 6.5% decrease in the expected number of gold medals ($e^{-0.06547} \approx 0.937$).

-   **Model Performance**:

    -   **Residual Deviance**: 3877.5 on 538 degrees of freedom, which is quite large, suggesting that the model might not be fitting the data well.
    -   **AIC**: 4799.3 (Poisson models tend to have higher AIC values when overdispersion is present).

#### Negative Binomial Regression (GLM)

-   **Negative Binomial Regression**, relaxes the strict assumption of equal mean and variance.

```{r}
# Fit a Negative Binomial GLM
model_glm_nb <- glm.nb(n ~ log_gdp + log_pop, data = newdata_clean)

# Summary of the model
summary(model_glm_nb)
```

-   **Intercept**: The intercept of $-1.98$ is slightly higher than in the Poisson model, indicating a higher baseline expected count of gold medals compared to the Poisson model.

-   **log_gdp**: A 1-unit increase in log-transformed GDP is associated with a 65% increase in the expected number of gold medals ($e^{0.64947} \approx 1.91$).

-   **log_pop**: The coefficient is not statistically significant ($p = 0.809$), meaning that population doesnâ€™t have a clear impact on the expected number of gold medals in this model.

-   **Model Performance**:

    -   **Residual Deviance**: 493.17 on 538 degrees of freedom, which is much lower than the Poisson model, suggesting a better fit.
    -   **AIC**: 2230.8 (significantly lower than the Poisson model's AIC, indicating a better model).

#### Comparing Models

```{r}
# Compare the AIC of different models
AIC(model_interaction, model_glm_poisson, model_glm_nb)
```

#### Diagnostics for GLMs

```{r}
# Set the margins smaller to avoid the error
par(mar = c(4, 4, 2, 1)) # Adjust as needed

# Now, create the diagnostic plot
plot(model_glm_poisson)
```

-   Residuals vs Fitted (Heteroscedasticity): The plot suggests some heteroscedasticity, as the residuals tend to fan out as fitted values increase. This is not ideal, as it indicates that the variance of the residuals changes with the predicted values. This behavior could be a sign that the Poisson model does not perfectly capture the variance structure of the data.

-   Q-Q Plot (Normality of Residuals): The Q-Q plot shows a significant deviation from normality, particularly in the tails. The residuals are far from the line, indicating that the assumption of normally distributed residuals is violated. This is a common occurrence with count data in Poisson models, which may not always have normally distributed residuals.

-   Scale-Location Plot (Homoscedasticity): The scale-location plot also shows heteroscedasticity, as the residuals appear to follow a non-constant spread. This further indicates that the modelâ€™s assumptions about variance are not well met.

-   Residuals vs Leverage (Influential Points): There are several points with high leverage and significant influence, suggesting that a few data points may disproportionately impact the modelâ€™s fit. Points like 407 and 122 may need closer examination, as they may unduly influence the modelâ€™s parameters.

-   Conclusion: it is clear that the Poisson model may not be the best fit. The heteroscedasticity, non-normal residuals, and high-leverage points indicate some issues.

## Part f: Coefficient Plot

```{r}
# Scale and center the predictors
newdata_clean <- newdata_clean %>%
  mutate(scaled_log_gdp = scale(log_gdp, center = TRUE, scale = TRUE),
         scaled_log_pop = scale(log_pop, center = TRUE, scale = TRUE))

# Fit the Poisson model with scaled and centered predictors
model_glm_scaled <- glm(n ~ scaled_log_gdp + scaled_log_pop, family = poisson(link = "log"), data = newdata_clean)

# Tidy the model coefficients
tidy_model <- tidy(model_glm_scaled)

# Plot the coefficients
dwplot(tidy_model) +
  ggtitle("Coefficient Plot for Scaled Predictors (Poisson Model)") +
  theme_minimal()
```

-   **Scaled_log_gdp**: The coefficient for scaled log_gdp is positive and significant, indicating that countries with higher GDPs (in the log scale) are more likely to win more medals.
-   **Scaled_log_pop**: The coefficient for scaled log_pop is near zero, indicating a weaker and less significant relationship between population size and the number of medals.
-   This coefficient plot confirms that **GDP** plays a much stronger role in predicting Olympic success compared to population size.

## Part g: Effects Plot

```{r}
# Calculate the effects for the poisson model
effects_poisson <- allEffects(model_glm_poisson)

# Plot the effects
plot(effects_poisson)
```

-   **Log GDP Effect**: The plot on the left shows a strong positive linear relationship between `log_gdp` and the predicted number of medals (`n`). As `log_gdp` increases, the number of predicted medals increases sharply. This suggests that GDP is a strong predictor of the number of medals a country wins. The confidence band is narrow, indicating high certainty around the prediction for the effect of GDP.

-   **Log Population Effect**: The plot on the right shows a weak negative relationship between `log_pop` and the predicted number of medals. As `log_pop` increases, the number of predicted medals decreases slightly. This might seem counterintuitive but reflects the negative (though weak) effect observed in the model coefficients. The confidence interval is wider here, indicating less certainty in the effect of population on medal counts, particularly as population increases.

-   **Summary**: **GDP** is a much stronger predictor of Olympic success (in terms of medal counts) than population, which aligns with the model coefficients. The large effect of GDP suggests that wealthier countries are more likely to win more medals. **Population** does not appear to have a substantial positive effect on medal counts, and there may even be a slight negative relationship when accounting for GDP.
