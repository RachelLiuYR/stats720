you'll get nicer output from check_model() if you set the figure height and width (set fig.height, fig.width in the chunk options, to something like 10 and 7) (you seem to have done this for the next plot, so why not this one?)

I wouldn't even bother checking collinearity ...

e) verbal description of comparison?

You never need `== TRUE` in R code; in this case it's a little weird, but you should use `isTRUE()` for `all.equal()`

ddf comparison: best to comment on the *practical* importance of these differences (==very small)

"does not provide a baseline estimate for the overall population-level effect of sex on attainment, so we cannot estimate an overall population level of sex on attainment"; this is a little misleading. The problem is that it sets the baseline estimate to zero (which is artificial/strange)

Definitely shouldn't compare AIC, log-likelihood in these ways; only *differences* in these metrics are important, and they can be evaluated on an *absolute* scale.

I'm curious what ChatGPT told you to do about addressing convergence failure (and how it differed from ?lme4::troubleshooting, ?lme4::convergence, or https://bbolker.github.io/mixedmodels-misc/glmmFAQ.html#convergence-warnings

Here is the guideline from ChatGPT 4o, to address convergence failure. 

I applied the solutions of A, G and F: scaled `verbal`, changed the optimizer or adjust optimizer settings (`optimizer = "bobyqa"`) and relaxed the tolerance settings (`optCtrl = list(maxfun = 1e6)`)

### **Common Causes and Solutions**

#### **A. Poorly Scaled Data**
Convergence issues often arise when predictors have vastly different scales.
- **Solution**: Scale the predictors.
  ```R
  mydata$scaled_predictor <- scale(mydata$predictor)
  ```

#### **B. Overly Complex Model**
The model might include unnecessary complexity (e.g., redundant random effects or correlations).
- **Solution**: Simplify the model by removing:
  - Random slopes if not essential: Replace `(1 + predictor | group)` with `(1 | group)`.
  - Correlations among random effects: Use `(1 | group)` instead of `(1 + predictor | group)` when correlation is not of interest.
  ```R
  model <- lmer(outcome ~ predictor1 + (1 | group), data = mydata)
  ```

#### **C. Insufficient Data**
There might not be enough data to estimate all model parameters (e.g., too few levels in the random effect grouping factor).
- **Solution**:
  - Aggregate data to increase sample size per group.
  - Remove random effects with insufficient levels.

#### **D. Random Effects Near Zero**
Random effect variances close to zero can cause instability.
- **Solution**: Remove those random effects or refit using `nloptwrap` optimizer (see below).

#### **E. Poor Initial Values**
Poor starting values for parameters can lead to non-convergence.
- **Solution**: Provide better initial values for the optimizer.
  ```R
  model <- lmer(outcome ~ predictor1 + (1 | group), data = mydata, start = list(...))
  ```

#### **F. Optimizer Issues**
The default optimizer may fail to converge.
- **Solution**: Change the optimizer or adjust optimizer settings.
  ```R
  library(lme4)
  model <- lmer(outcome ~ predictor1 + (1 | group), data = mydata,
                control = lmerControl(optimizer = "bobyqa"))
  ```

#### **G. Convergence Tolerance**
The default convergence tolerance might be too strict.
- **Solution**: Relax the tolerance settings.
  ```R
  model <- lmer(outcome ~ predictor1 + (1 | group), data = mydata,
                control = lmerControl(optCtrl = list(maxfun = 100000)))
  ```
